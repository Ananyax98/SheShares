Women empowerment refers to the process of granting women the ability and confidence to make choices that impact their lives positively. It involves enhancing their sense of self-worth, their right to have access to opportunities and resources, and the power to control their own lives.

Empowering women is crucial for achieving gender equality and fostering sustainable development. It encompasses various aspects such as education, economic independence, political participation, and social equality. When women are empowered, societies benefit from their contributions to economic growth, community development, and the overall well-being of families.

Efforts towards women empowerment often focus on breaking down barriers that prevent women from realizing their full potential. This includes challenging discriminatory norms and laws, promoting education for girls, ensuring access to healthcare, supporting entrepreneurship, and advocating for equal rights in all spheres of life.
